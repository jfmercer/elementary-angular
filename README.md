### Ossa AngularÄ« Sola Ad Mentum Ioannis Rationemque

---

### Description

This project proposes a simple, foundational architecture for a new Angular project.

To give credit where credit is due, this project is not entirely _Ad Mentum
Ioannis Rationemque_; it uses [angular-cli](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) as
its primary scaffolding tool.
